# StreamLite Installation Guide for CyberPanel

This guide provides detailed steps for installing StreamLite on a CyberPanel managed server.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. A CyberPanel-managed server running Ubuntu 20.04 or later
2. SSH access to your server
3. Python 3.8+ installed
4. Basic knowledge of command line operations

## Installation Steps

### 1. Setting Up Website in CyberPanel

1. Log in to your CyberPanel admin interface.
2. Navigate to **Websites** > **Create Website**.
3. Enter your domain name and other required details.
4. Select the appropriate package and click **Create Website**.

### 2. Configure Python Application (Optional)

If CyberPanel has a Python App configuration option:

1. Go to **Websites** > **List Websites**.
2. Select your website.
3. Look for a **Python App** or similar option.
4. Configure the Python application settings:
   - **Application Directory**: Path to your application (typically `/home/username/streamlite`)
   - **Application Startup File**: `main.py`
   - **Application Entry Point**: `app`
   - **Python Version**: Select 3.8 or higher

### 3. Setting Up Virtual Environment Manually

To set up a virtual environment for StreamLite:

1. Connect to your server via SSH.
2. Navigate to your application directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/username/streamlite
   ```

3. Install the Python virtual environment package (if not already installed):
   
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   
   # For Ubuntu 20.04+ with specific Python version
   sudo apt install python3.10-venv  # Replace 3.10 with your Python version
   
   # For CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install python3-devel
   ```

4. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   
   If you encounter the error "ensurepip is not available," it means the Python venv package is not installed. Use the commands in step 3 to install it.

5. Activate the virtual environment:
